Below are some steps on how to use nmap, which is an open source tool used for network discovery and security audits. Basically, it allows users to discover hosts on a network, identify the services running on those hosts, and detect vulnerabilities.
We will conduct the lab with the vulnerable machine Metasploit 2.
